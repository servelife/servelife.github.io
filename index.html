          <p><a href="http://www.servelife.com">ServeLife's</a> mission isn't to change the world. Instead we endeavor to organize those who will. 
Key to this mission is equipping people with knowledge and expertise that empowers and enables. Learning projects are one such way we accomplish this. A ServeLife Learning Project is an experience that helps users transform knowledge into relevant skills to better themselves and those around them.</p>

          </h3>
          <p> All projects start with a single path defined; guiding participants through a series of recipes (or set of instructions) that incrementally accomplishes the project's goals. Yet ServeLife Learning Projects are open sourced and community-owned. Anyone can create and contribute new learning projects and alternative recipes. It's easy to do. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork a project or recipe</a>, make your changes and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer to learn alone, no problem! Find a project that interests you and get started. Everything you need 
                should be explained on the project's home page. Yet remember if you discover something is missing or believe changes are needed, you have the power to 
                make whatever modifications necessary.</p>
                <p>Or better yet, <a href="http://www.servelife.com/signup">sign up</a> and become a member of the <a href="http://www.servelife.com">ServeLife</a> community. Join others from around the globe that are just like you; people that want to better themselves while helping the world around them. Your knowledge and active contribution can make a difference in someone else's life. Pick yourself and discover the impact you can make in the world.</p>
